# Competitve Programming

Source code for programming questions done on multiple online judges. The most recently updated are Leetcode and CtCI (Cracking the coding interview). C++ code is written in C++ 11. Python code is mostly written in Python 3.6<br />

## Notes

* Leetcode questions are downloaded using the<a href = 'https://github.com/skygragon/leetcode-cli'> Leetcode CLI</a>

* Code Snippets contains Python implmentations of often used code such as Data Structures and API requests.

* Tags such as (Good_X.x) in ./CTCI/ are memorable questions with intelligent solutions.

* Some solutions in ./CTCI/ have multiple functions that implement different solutions from my own attempts and coding the optimal solution from the answer book.
