# Methods of solving questions
## Sorting
* In many cases, can be further optimized by priority queues (heaps)

## Hashing
* 560 Subarray Sum

## Two Pointers

## Sliding Window

## Stack/Queue/Deque

## Priority Queue

## Sum array



# General tips
* Using waste space in ints
* Queues to traverse binary trees at each level (and bfs)
* Cut down for n^2 for loop logic by setting init of second loop to first look value
	* for a in range(sums):
		* for b in range(a, sums):



# Notes
Heap is a tree where every child node is smaller than the parent
	Useful in priority queues


# Case checks
* Edge case checking
* Null case
* First case in array
* Last case in array
* Check going forwards and backwards
* Can adjacent array elements be combined? (188)
